# Watson Studio Workshop

This repository holds the source material for my Watson Studio Workshop.

For this workshop all the materials are in box folder: https://ibm.box.com/v/WatsonWorkshopsLH

If you have allready made IBMid you can skip first part of Lab 1, but if you don't have IBMid you can find instructions there.

It is highly suggested to go through every lab, they are located in **WatStudLabs** folder.


After labs we would love to hear your opinion and we hope you could leave feedback to us. The feedback form is in Box folder. Fill the form and send it to <lasse.huotari@ibm.com>
