# Watson Studio Workshop

This repository holds the source material for my Watson Studio Workshop.

For this workshop all the materials are in box folder:

It is highly suggested to go through every lab, but in Lab 5 Machine learning, there is couple of options. lab4 bis if optional, but it uses same modeler flow which was used in lab 4 time series.

Lab 7 is about Deep learning, and because deep learning isn't actual part of this workshop whose labs are optional too.
