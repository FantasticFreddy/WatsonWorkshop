# Lab 3 - Spark
This hands-on lab will be essentially driven by the instructions in the `Learn basics about notebooks and Apache Spark.ipynb` notebook.

We will use a rather large (>1MB) data file, named `2017.csv`, which will need to be loaded as a Data Asset of the project

### Setting up the Hands-On lab notebook
1. Go to your `DSX_Workshop` project, switch to the Assets tab
1. Open the Data panel with ![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20180311222504140.png), switch to the Load tab and add the `2017.csv` file. This will take some time but can be run in the background
1. Add a new notebook from the Assets tab, using the `From file` option and selecting the `Learn basics about notebooks and Apache Spark.ipynb` file.
1. Make sure you have a Spark runtime selected (named `spark-xy`). If not, you will need to create a new `Lite` instance.

### Run the Hands-On through the notebook
Open the notebook and follow the instructions
