    "\n",
    "[Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is a fast open-source engine for large-scale data processing. It is built for speed and ease of use. Through the advanced DAG execution engine that supports cyclic data flow and in-memory computing, programs can run up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10 times faster on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark consists of multiple components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Spark Core__ is the underlying computation engine with the fundamental programming abstraction called __R__ esilient __D__ istributed __D__ atasets (__RDD__ s)\n",
    "* __Spark SQL__ provides a new data abstraction called DataFrames for structured data processing with SQL and domain-specific language\n",
    "* __MLlib__ is a scalable machine learning framework for delivering fast distributed algorithms for mining big data\n",
    "* __Streaming__ leverages Spark's fast scheduling capability to perform real-time analysis on streams of new data\n",
    "* __GraphX__ is the graph processing framework for the analysis of graph structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory tutorial example, you will focus on `Spark Core` and `Spark SQL` by using the Python API."
